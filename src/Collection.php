 * Collection
 * 
 * Container class for Activity objects/Objects, representing a collection/
 * stream/feed of objects.
 * 
 * The minimum required properties are one of either $items or $url. Typically 
 * $url would be used in cases where it’s not appropriate to load the entire 
 * contents of the collection (e.g. embedded collections). The spec says $url 
 * should be to a JSON file, IMO this is not webby. It should be the URL of the 
 * resource, and it should respond intelligently to content negotiation.
